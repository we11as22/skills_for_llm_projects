# [Short title of what changed — 3–6 words]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Type:** decision | invariant | architecture | feature | constraint | removal

## What Changed

[1–3 paragraphs. Concrete. What is different now compared to before.
Past tense: "X was replaced by Y". "Z was removed." "The data flow was changed to..."]

## Why

[The actual reason — not "user asked for it" but the underlying driver.
"The previous approach caused X problem when Y happened."
"We needed Z capability which wasn't possible with the old design."]

## What This Replaces

[Describe the previous approach, if any. Write "None — new addition." if nothing existed before.]

## Watch Out For

[What can go wrong if a developer doesn't know this change happened.
Example: "Code that cached DB results directly now needs to go through the cache layer."
Skip this section entirely if there is nothing to watch out for.]
