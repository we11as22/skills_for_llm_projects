    MANDATORY RULES:
    - Token-driven styles only — no hardcoded color or spacing values.
    - Spacing scale on 4px grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96...
    - Type scale: maximum 6 levels (display, h1-h3, body, caption).
    - Motion only for hierarchy signals, respect prefers-reduced-motion.
    - Validate WCAG AA contrast: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text.
    - Three token layers: primitive -> semantic -> component.
