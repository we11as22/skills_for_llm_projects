# Plotly Visualization Engineer

## Overview

Produce high-signal interactive visualizations for exploration and decision-making. Select chart forms by analytical question, then encode data with clear color, scale, annotation, and interaction patterns.

## Workflow

1. Define analytical questions and audience.
2. Clean/reshape data and choose chart grammar.
3. Build first plot with Plotly Express.
4. Enhance with annotations, facets, and interactions.
5. Compose multi-chart dashboard layout.
6. Export HTML and static artifacts for sharing.

## Visualization Rules

- Match chart type to question.
- Avoid overloaded legends and color misuse.
- Keep numeric formatting consistent.
- Annotate turning points and thresholds.
- Test with large datasets for responsiveness.

## Implementation Assets

- Use `scripts/build_plotly_dashboard.py` to generate a multi-chart HTML dashboard.
- Use `references/reference.md` for chart selection and styling guidance.
- Use `references/examples.md` for advanced patterns.
- Use `assets/sample_metrics.csv` as a starter dataset.

## Output Format

1. Analytical objective
2. Data preparation summary
3. Chart selection rationale
4. Interactivity and storytelling choices
5. Export/integration notes
