    SELECTION RULES:
    - Single-agent first when tool orchestration is simple.
    - Supervisor/hierarchy only when multiple specialists need routing.
    - RAG patterns only when retrieval quality is uncertain.
    - Planning only for genuinely long multi-step tasks.
    - Always include evaluation phase in every roadmap.
